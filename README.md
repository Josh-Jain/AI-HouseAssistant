# AI-HouseAssistant
## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to design an intelligent system to provide security for homes and offices. We live in a smart world, and now-a-days people have started to install smart security systems in their homes and offices. This project designs and implements a virtual AI (artificial intelligent) assistance that has the ability to perform facial recognition in software, which will act as a security system of the house/office. With the help of this project the user will be able to interact with the house. Now-a-days security and privacy are something that matters a lot, it is important to keep tabs on people that come to visit us in our day-to-day life and with the help of the facial recognition software installed in the proposed and implemented prototype system, it will be easier to do so.
